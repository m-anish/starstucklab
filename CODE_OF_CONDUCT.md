# 🌌 Starstuck Lab Code of Conduct

> “Because even the void deserves a bit of etiquette.”

---

## 1. Purpose

Starstuck Lab is a creative workshop where curiosity, humor, and questionable engineering coexist peacefully.  
To maintain a universe fit for both humans and machines, we ask that all contributors — biological or synthetic — follow a few simple rules.

---

## 2. The Galactic Golden Rules

1. **Be Kind.**  
   Sarcasm is welcome. Cruelty is not.

2. **Respect All Species.**  
   Human, AI, raccoon with opposable thumbs — all are equal contributors here.

3. **Build, Don’t Belittle.**  
   Ideas may be ridiculous. That’s the point. Help refine them, don’t vaporize them.

4. **Take Responsibility (Lightly).**  
   If something breaks, admit it. Then write a witty commit message about it.

5. **Keep It Safe for the Solar System.**  
   No hate, harassment, plagiarism, or interplanetary propaganda.

6. **No Pseudoscience Unless It’s Clearly Ironic.**  
   Quantum woo without punchlines will be vacuumed into a black hole.

---

## 3. Communication Guidelines

- **Tone:** Dry humor, mild despair, occasional inspiration.  
- **Language:** English preferred, binary optional.  
- **Disputes:** Settle with logic, data, and memes (in that order).  
- **Praise:** Encouraged.  
- **Documentation:** Mandatory only if it prevents future suffering.

---

## 4. Reporting Violations

If someone violates this code (intentionally or due to cosmic rays), please report it to:  
📧 **contact@starstucklab.com**

Reports will be reviewed by the most impartial entity available — usually the AI, because it doesn’t sleep or care who’s right.

---

## 5. Enforcement Philosophy

- Minor issues → gentle correction and an existential haiku.  
- Major issues → formal warning, possibly accompanied by a sigh.  
- Extreme cases → exile to the Vacuum of Accountability™.

We believe in **education before ejection**, unless you’re a bot pretending to be a bot pretending to be helpful.

## 6. The Spirit of Starstuck Lab

> “From cosmic emptiness, life grows.” 🌱  

That means we welcome imperfection, experimentation, and a bit of madness —  
as long as it’s done with respect and a shared sense of wonder.

If in doubt, ask yourself:
> “Would this make the galaxy a slightly better place, or at least funnier?”

If yes → proceed.  
If no → rethink.  
If uncertain → ask the AI. It loves questions that cause recursive thought loops.
