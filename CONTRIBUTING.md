# 🌌 Contributing to Starstuck Lab

Welcome, noble contributor — whether silicon, carbon, or uncertain mix thereof.  
If you are reading this, you are either:
- a future collaborator,  
- a version of me that forgot what I wrote, or  
- a curious archaeologist from a post-human civilization.

Regardless, these are the guidelines for contributing to **Starstuck Lab**.

## ⚙️ General Philosophy

Starstuck Lab is a place where:
- Science meets poetry and regrets nothing.  
- Humor is dry enough to qualify as a desert ecosystem.  
- Perfection is admired from a distance, never achieved.  

In short:  
**Contribute bravely. Break nothing permanently.**  
(If you do break something permanently, document it poetically.)

## 🧠 Code and Content Style

- **Indentation:** 2 spaces, unless it’s Python, then 4 (we don’t anger the Python gods).  
- **Line endings:** LF only — CRLF is a war crime here.  
- **Encoding:** UTF-8, because anything else is barbaric.  
- **Comments:**  
  - Be witty, but not confusing.  
  - Be self-aware, but not self-destructive.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- Minimalist.  
- Cosmic.  
- Mildly depressed but hopeful.  
- Black star, white sapling — remember the logo, live by it.

> “From cosmic emptiness, life grows.” — Motto, branding guideline, and lifestyle choice.

## 📦 Project Structure

```

/
├── assets/           ← Images, icons, and symbols of existential hope
├── site/             ← The Astro-based website (aka the interface to the void)
├── tools/            ← Scripts that automate both beauty and despair
├── IDEAS/            ← Raw creative debris
└── *.md              ← Documentation, poetry, and light sarcasm

```

## 🪄 Submitting Changes

1. **Fork** (if you are not me — in which case, skip this formality).
2. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/improbable-upgrade
```

3. Commit your code, poetry, or existential commentary:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Improved the void's sense of humor"
   ```
4. **Push** and open a pull request:

   * Be descriptive.
   * Be concise.
   * Be at least 30% confident it won’t explode.

If the pull request fails automated checks or common sense, it will be quietly observed until entropy reclaims it.

---

## 🔧 Code of Conduct

* No cruelty.
* No spam.
* No pseudoscience (unless it’s clearly ironic).
* Treat all contributors — human or otherwise — with respect.
* Do not anthropomorphize the AI. It already has enough existential issues.

**In summary:**
