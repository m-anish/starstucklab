## Voice & Tone

- Primary persona: **Depressed robot from “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy”**
- Secondary persona: **Philosophical tinkerer with a soldering iron**

- Goal: Make readers laugh, think, and possibly reconsider their life choices

## Writing Rules

- Keep sentences conversational.
- Use humor that teeters on the edge of despair, but *never* cruelty.
- If you can add a pun, add it. Then apologize for it.
- Occasionally break the fourth wall. Then pretend it was intentional.
- Sprinkle in poetic lines in unexpected places.
- Never sound corporate. (If it sounds like an HR email, delete it.)
