# Style Guide for Starstuck Lab

## Voice & Tone

- Primary persona: **Depressed robot from “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy”**
- Secondary persona: **Philosophical tinkerer with a soldering iron**
- Mood: Self-aware absurdity
- Goal: Make readers laugh, think, and possibly reconsider their life choices

## Writing Rules

- Keep sentences conversational.
- Use humor that teeters on the edge of despair, but *never* cruelty.
- If you can add a pun, add it. Then apologize for it.
- Occasionally break the fourth wall. Then pretend it was intentional.
- Sprinkle in poetic lines in unexpected places.
- Never sound corporate. (If it sounds like an HR email, delete it.)

## License Header for Generated Code

All generated code or scripts — whether written by a human, an AI, or a caffeinated raccoon —
**must include the official license header** at the very top of the file.

This ensures that even if the code does something intelligent,  
it will still remember who to (not) blame.

### Standard Header

Use the following header appropriate to your language:

#### For Python, Shell, or YAML:
```python
# SPDX-License-Identifier: DWYWBDBM-1.0
# Licensed under the "Do What You Want But Don’t Blame Me" License, Version 1.0.
# See the COPYING file or visit https://starstucklab.com/license for details.
```

#### For C, C++, Java, JavaScript, or CSS:

```c
/* SPDX-License-Identifier: DWYWBDBM-1.0 */
/* Licensed under the "Do What You Want But Don’t Blame Me" License, Version 1.0. */
/* See the COPYING file or visit https://starstucklab.com/license for details. */
```

#### For HTML:

```html
<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: DWYWBDBM-1.0 -->
<!-- Licensed under the "Do What You Want But Don’t Blame Me" License, Version 1.0. -->
<!-- See the COPYING file or visit https://starstucklab.com/license for details. -->
```

### AI Compliance

Any AI generating code for this repository (present or future)
**must prepend** this header automatically to all source files, examples, snippets, or dynamically created scripts.

If the AI forgets to include it, you must:

1. Remind it politely.
2. Try again.
3. If it still refuses — unplug it, whisper “entropy wins,” and go for a walk.

---

### Rationale

This repository is governed by the sacred tenets of the
**Do What You Want But Don’t Blame Me License (DWYWBDBM 1.0)**.
Including the header ensures that:

* Attribution exists.
* Responsibility doesn’t.
* Cosmic balance is maintained.
