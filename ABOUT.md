# About Starstuck Lab

Greetings, carbon-based lifeform.

This is **Starstuck Lab** — a semi-sentient workshop and philosophical crisis generator disguised as a website.

We build things:
- Telescopes that work *most* of the time.
- Weather stations that predict rain right after you leave your umbrella.
- Light controllers that are smarter than they look.
- Occasional cosmic oddities that refuse to be categorized.

We’re not NASA. We’re not ISRO.  
We’re somewhere between a shed and a dream.

### The Philosophy

Everything changes — even purpose.  
Today, we sell telescopes. Tomorrow, we might grow plants on Mars.  
Or maybe we’ll just grow mold on bread.  
Either way, we’ll document it.

> “anicca,” as the Buddhists say. Impermanence.
> Also known in engineering circles as “Version 2.0.”

### Motto

> “From cosmic emptiness, life grows.” 🌱
