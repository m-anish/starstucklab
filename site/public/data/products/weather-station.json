A lanyard loop waits for a carabiner that might someday leave the drawer. The circuit inside is overqualified for watching clouds that will form and vanish whether anyone is counting. Still, it logs each gust and drop with patient, unromantic precision, a pocket witness to passing fronts and passing days, quietly recording how the weather changes and how little that changes anything at all.</p>",
