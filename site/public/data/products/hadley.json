The motions are simple, almost stubborn: up, down, left, right, like a wooden toy that learned orbital mechanics from a library book. It will not change the course of any galaxy, and the stars will not blink in appreciation, but it will quietly fold distant light into a circle of glass and offer it to whoever is still awake. A small machine, doing its best to make the universe feel closer, even as the universe keeps drifting away.</p>",
