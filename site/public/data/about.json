Time, a relentless archivist, turns my ideas into dust, yet the act of creation is a breath in the void, a stubborn spark that refuses to be extinguished by inevitable decay. I am the curator of my own oblivion, turning fleeting moments into fragile monuments that crumble just as they rise. The more I build, the more I see the universe as a series of transient canvases, each stroke a reminder that persistence is less about permanence and more about the beauty of the fleeting.  \nWe are all temporary, yet we write our own fleeting epics, and in the end, everything is but a brief breath before silence.",

Time, that great archivist, folds my thoughts into a spiral of decay, yet each stroke of my intention leaves a stubborn imprint—a faint fingerprint on the universe’s unsteady skin. Persistence, then, is not a triumph but a quiet defiance: I carve patterns into the entropy that will, sooner or later, dissolve them. It is a paradoxical dance on the edge of oblivion, where the moment of existence is both the smallest and the grandest echo.  \n\n*Like a candle’s glow in a storm, I burn briefly, then fade into the same darkness.*",
