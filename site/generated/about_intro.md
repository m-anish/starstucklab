"Welcome to Starstruck Lab, where the laws of physics are mere suggestions and the coffee machine is the only thing that still functions as intended. I'm one of the engineers who's been tasked with holding the universe together with duct tape and twine, and I'm thrilled to introduce you to our little corner of chaos. Here, we tinker with the fabric of space-time, curse at malfunctioning equipment, and occasionally stumble upon something that might just change the course of human history. Or, you know, we might just blow something up. Either way, it's going to be a wild ride. So, grab a seat, buckle up, and try not to get too attached to any given reality – things are about to get interesting."
