"Ugh, another day, another galaxy to save. Welcome to Starstruck Lab, where the coffee is stronger than the gravitational pull of a black hole and the problems are more complex than a supernova's tax return. I'm your cosmic engineer, still trying to figure out how to get the Andromeda Galaxy's Wi-Fi to work without crashing the entire space-time continuum. Here, we tinker with the fabric of space, attempt to defy the laws of physics, and occasionally manage to create something that doesn't immediately implode. It's a miracle we get anything done, but somehow, we do. So, buckle up, grab a snack (preferably not the import from planet Zorgon, trust me on that one), and join me on this wild ride through the Starstruck Lab, where the only constant is chaos and the only rule is that there are no rules... except for maybe that one about not pressing the big red button. Don't press the big red button."
