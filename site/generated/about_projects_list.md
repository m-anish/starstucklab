- I assemble telescopes that stare into forgotten voids.  
- I build weather stations that mourn the sky's fickleness.  
- I craft light controllers, dimming brilliance with quiet resignation.  
- I design circuits that listen to the hum of silence.  
- I program algorithms that predict rain, yet never feel wet.
