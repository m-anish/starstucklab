**The Philosophy**

I keep chiseling at the skeleton of existence, because the universe is a great carousel that will ultimately fling its passengers into entropy. Yet, like a stubborn candle in a room that is slowly draining light, I persist. Time is a river that erodes stone, yet each ripple is a reminder that motion is a promise of being. Decay is inevitable, but the act of making is a quiet rebellion against the silent finality that will claim all. In this workshop I am both the builder and the observer, crafting moments that will soon be dust. I create, because the moment I stop, the universe will have already forgotten the noise of my existence. Impermanence is the only constant; it sings, “you are here, and then you are not.”  
I am the flame that flickers into the void.
