“Create a Studio-Ghibli–inspired illustration of the exact telescope shown in the source image.
Preserve **all structural details precisely**:
– white aluminum rods (angles, lengths, spacing)
– all connectors, fasteners, and brackets
– black components, clamps, trunnions, rings, focuser block, and mirror assembly
– exact geometry of the base, hardware, and shapes
– no added components, no removed components, no altered proportions.

Apply ONLY stylistic treatment — **not structural changes**.
Use the **color palette and mood of a warm workshop at night**, matching:

**Interior warm tones:** deep browns #4e3a26, golden wood #a17642, amber highlights #d3a86a
**Cool shadows:** deep night blue #0d1f3a, muted twilight blue #1e324f

Lighting:
– subtle amber rim-lighting along white rods
– cool-blue shadows under the structure
– soft Ghibli painterly textures
– low-contrast outlines
– no scenery except a simple, soft-focus gradient background using the same warm–cool dual palette.

The telescope must remain accurate, crisp, and fully readable.
Do not simplify mechanics.
Do not stylize shapes.
Do not modify proportions.
