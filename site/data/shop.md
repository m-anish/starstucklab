**Prompt:**
“Create a soft, Studio-Ghibli–inspired illustration of a cozy nighttime workshop interior, using the **same warm–cool palette** as a warm wooden cabin lit by amber lamps, with deep blue nighttime shadows.

**Palette constraints (strict):**
– warm wood: #4e3a26 → #a17642
– amber lamp glow: #d3a86a
– cool deep shadows: #0d1f3a, #1e324f
– soft starlight/cool highlights: #cfd8e5

**Composition rules:**
– Central 40% vertical band must be **calm, clean, and low-detail** for product overlays.
– No table, no bench, no objects in the center area.
– A window or pinboard may be present but kept very faint, low-contrast.
– Warm wooden walls with soft texture.
– A single desk lamp or hanging lamp may glow, but **only softly**, no bright hotspot.
– Light transitions must match the master image’s warm-amber interior + cool-blue shadow interplay.

**Side shelves (left/right 20% only):**
– low-contrast silhouettes of tools, gadgets, telescope parts
– all painted in the same **warm-shadow cool-light dual palette**
– no crisp edges, no readable text, no distracting elements

**Overall mood:**
– cozy nighttime workshop
– warm interior light pooling softly
– cool shadows with subtle depth
– painterly Ghibli strokes
– no bright colors, no saturated tones, no modern neon.

**Aspect Ratio:** 16:9
**Must remain clean and nondistracting when darkened 50–70%.
Must look good with white aluminum and black mechanical components placed in front.”**
