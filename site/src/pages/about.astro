  <h1>About Starstuck Lab</h1>
  <p>
    Greetings, carbon-based lifeform. This is <strong>Starstuck Lab</strong> — a semi-sentient workshop and philosophical
    crisis generator disguised as a website.
  </p>
  <p>
    We build things that may or may not work: telescopes, weather stations, and other cosmic oddities that defy categories.

  <blockquote>“anicca,” as the Buddhists say. Impermanence. Also known in engineering circles as “Version 2.0.”</blockquote>
