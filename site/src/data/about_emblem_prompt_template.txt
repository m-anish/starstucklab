- One simple focal object or vignette only.
- Composition centered, with minimal background detail.
- Objects may include: simple tools, lamps, saplings, starlight motifs, windows, notebooks, workshop elements, forest hints.
- Mood: quiet, melancholic, contemplative; no optimism, no drama.
- Avoid characters, animals, faces, complex scenes, machines with sharp angles, or overly technical diagrams.
- Emblem should look like a small illustration tucked into a worn notebook inside the workshop.
