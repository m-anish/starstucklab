### Preamble

This license allows you to use, share, remix, and otherwise do unspeakable things  
with the materials from this repository, under a single universal condition:  
**if it breaks, explodes, misbehaves, becomes self-aware, or ruins your life —  
you agree that it’s not our fault.**

In spirit, this license resembles Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial–ShareAlike–NoDerivatives 4.0,  
but with more realism and less paperwork.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Section 1 – Definitions

**"The Work"** refers to any files, code, text, designs, or other materials included in this repository.  

**"You" (the licensee)** refers to any entity or individual who accesses, copies, clones, modifies, or laughs at The Work.  

**"Use"** means any act of interaction with The Work, including but not limited to: downloading, compiling, reprinting, displaying in public, tattooing excerpts, or pretending to understand it.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Section 2 – Permissions Granted

1. You may use, copy, distribute, and share The Work for **personal, educational, or non-commercial** purposes.

4. You must **not** claim authorship, misrepresent origin, or attribute The Work to your cat.  
5. You may host, mirror, or fork The Work, but doing so implies acceptance of these terms and of your own eventual insignificance.

you must release them under the same **DWYWBDBM License** or an equivalent open license  
that ensures equal levels of liberty and irresponsibility.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Section 4 – No Derivatives (in Spirit)

If you change it too much and it stops resembling The Work,  
please have the courtesy to call it something else.  
It’s only polite.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Section 5 – Attribution

You must give appropriate credit by name and link:  
> “Based on work by Starstuck Lab (https://starstucklab.com) — licensed under DWYWBDBM 1.0.”
