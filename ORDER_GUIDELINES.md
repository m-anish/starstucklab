# Order Guidelines

Please read carefully before attempting to part with your money.

1. Each product is handmade, 3D-printed, or otherwise cobbled together.
2. Customization is allowed — within reason and sanity.
3. Expect minor imperfections.  
   (We call them *personality features*.)
4. Delivery timelines are approximate. Like time itself.
5. Refunds? Let’s talk. I’m reasonable.  
   The universe, however, is not.
