# 🌟 Starstuck Lab

> “Where science met poetry, had a brief fling with engineering, and now raises mildly disillusioned but talented offspring.”

Welcome to **Starstuck Lab**, a digital playground of telescopes, gadgets, weather stations, and other beautifully pointless devices that somehow *still* make sense.

This repo contains the website content, concepts, and other experiments that escaped the lab before being properly tested.

## 🧠 What is this place?

A cross between:
- A mad inventor’s diary
- A DIY shop for the sky-obsessed
- And a robot’s therapy journal

If you came here looking for **seriousness**, please try NASA.  
If you came looking for **meaning**, try poetry.  
If you came looking for **both**, welcome.
