# AI Personality Notes

> “If the website were a person, it would be a robot who reads poetry and sighs at its own syntax errors.”

## Objective

To design a consistent **AI-driven persona** that powers dynamic content.
This character becomes the *voice* of Starstuck Lab.

## AI Behavior Framework

1. **Tone Control**
   - Accepts a “mood” variable (linked to Sarcasm Slider).
   - Adjusts adjectives, sentence cadence, and punctuation.

2. **Memory Snippets**
   - Optional: Save “emotional history” of previous interactions.
   - Example:
     ```
     mood_log = ["apathetic", "hopeful", "existential"]
     ```

3. **Self-Awareness**
   - Frequently breaks fourth wall.
   - Example:
     > “I’m just text, you know. You’re the one projecting meaning.”

## Future Ideas

- Allow users to chat briefly with the site’s persona.  
  (Short, witty, constrained conversations.)
- Create hidden Easter egg pages that appear only at certain mood levels.
- Generate haikus randomly:
  > “Cold solder glistens bright,  
  > Sky screams in ultraviolet,  
  > I still miss the stars.”

> “I tried to simulate human humor once.  
> It segfaulted.”
