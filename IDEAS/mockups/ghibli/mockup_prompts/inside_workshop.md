# **Inside Workshop**

A warm, hand-painted, Studio-Ghibli–inspired night-time workshop interior.

## **Core Composition Rules (STRICT)**

* Aspect ratio: **16:10**
* **Workbench, desk lamp, and four-pane window** must sit **exactly at the horizontal center**.
* The composition must remain **strictly center-aligned** so a **9:16 center crop** preserves the workbench, lamp, and **entire window** with no clipping.
* Show **some floor (~15–25%)** and **some ceiling (~12–18%)** to make it a full-room view. Some of the wood on the floor should be a little weathered. The stool base should be completely visible with 7-10% empty space in front of it.
* The **workbench surface** sits roughly in the **central 40%** of the frame; lamp head at **48–52%** of image height.
* The **window must be proportionally small enough** that even a **vertical 9:16 crop** keeps it fully visible.
  * Bottom of window ≥ **12–15% above** the image bottom (to avoid mobile cropping).
  * Top of window well below ceiling line.
* **Leftmost and rightmost 20%**: non-essential details (shelves, pegboards, beams) only — keep center safe.

## **Focal Elements**

* Centered **wooden workbench** (warm brown #5b4736) with scattered small tools, jars, and a glowing **vintage desk lamp** emitting warm amber light (#f4ce84).
* Soft greenish solder fumes rising from a small active solder joint.
* A small stool aligned perfectly to the workbench.

## **Window & Exterior**

* Perfectly centered **four-pane window**, compact in size for mobile safety.
* Outside: deep blue-black forest night (#1c2b3e → #0b1b2c) with soft stars (#dbe0e8).
* Include a **silhouette of a bear** among pine trees — no facial detail.

## **Room Interior**

* Warm timber walls (#5b4736). With subtle pale olive green accents.
* **Left shelves**: retro electronics, meters, wires, connectors.
* **Right shelves**: jars, small 3D printer, tools.
* **Pegboards** on both sides with hand tools, somewhat disorganised.
* **Noticeboard** faded olive green with some notes pinned. Subtle.
* **Floor**: rough wood with scattered scraps and cables, but visually subtle.
* **Ceiling**: visible wooden beams or rafters, softly lit, maintaining atmospheric depth.
* **Right side of the room**: A **Dobsonian telescope** sitting on the floor, pointing away. 

## **Lighting & Style**

* Warm key light from the lamp; soft cool fill from the window.
* Painterly, hand-drawn, Ghibli-inspired strokes; textured shadows; no hard edges.
* No text or readable labels anywhere.
