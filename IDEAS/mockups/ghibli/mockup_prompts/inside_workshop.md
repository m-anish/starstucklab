# inside_workshop.md (FINAL, MATCHING HERO FORMAT)

A warm, hand-painted digital illustration in a soft, Studio-Ghibli–inspired style.
The scene shows a nighttime forest workshop interior under a quiet, star-filled sky visible through a central window.
This image will be used as a major website artwork, so **precise composition rules must be followed**.

---

## COMPOSITION (STRICT RULES):

* The **workbench, desk lamp, and the central window** must be placed **EXACTLY at the horizontal center** of the image.
* Vertically, the **workbench surface** must sit in the **center 40%** of the image.
  The lamp head should fall approximately at **48–52%** of the total image height.
  Do **NOT** place the bench near the bottom edge.
* The **central four-pane window** must also be centered precisely behind the workbench.
  Its bottom frame must be at least **12–15% above** the bottom of the image.
  There must be a clean margin so the window is never clipped on wide desktop screens.
* Maintain a clean **safe zone**:
  The **leftmost 20% and rightmost 20%** must contain only shelves, tools, beams, wood walls, and negative space — nothing crucial —
  so a **9:16 center crop** preserves the entire workbench / lamp / window composition.
* The entire design must remain **center-weighted** so the middle vertical slice is automatically a perfect mobile composition.

---

## WORKBENCH & LAMP (FOCAL ELEMENTS):

* The workbench is made of warm brown timber **#5b4736**, centered exactly.
* On the bench: scattered tools (precision screwdrivers, pliers, soldering iron, wire spools, jars, brushes), light clutter but readable.
* A vintage adjustable desk lamp casts a warm amber glow **#f4ce84** over the workspace.
* A faint trail of **greenish solder fumes** rises softly from a small soldering joint.
* A small crooked workshop stool sits directly in front of the bench, aligned to center.

---

## WINDOW & OUTSIDE VIEW:

* The window is a **four-pane wooden frame**, perfectly centered behind the bench.
* Through it: a deep, blue-black forest night in tones **#1c2b3e → #0b1b2c**.
* Include a subtle star field, painterly and soft.
* A **faint silhouette of a bear** among pine trees must be visible, but **ONLY as a silhouette**, with no facial details.
  The bear should stand in the lower-middle part of the window view, recognizable but understated.

---

## SURROUNDINGS (INTERIOR):

* Walls are wooden planks in warm brown **#5b4736**, matching the workshop theme.
* **Left side shelves**: retro electronics, old computers, meters, boxes, cables.
* **Right side shelves**: jars, containers, tools, and a small 3D printer.
* **Pegboards** on both sides: neatly arranged pliers, screwdrivers, hammers, chisels, saws.
* **Floor**: rough, warm timber with small scattered objects (cables, scrap wood, tools).
* The side areas must remain visually interesting but non-essential, to maintain the safe crop zone.

---

## SKY & NIGHT COLOR THROUGH WINDOW:

* Deep night gradient **#1c2b3e → #0b1b2c**, consistent with the hero scene’s astronomy palette.
* Soft, subtle grain **#dbe0e8** to imply a natural night atmosphere.
* No constellations required, but stars should feel organic and varied.

---

## ART STYLE:

* Painterly, hand-drawn, soft, Ghibli-influenced strokes.
* Warm, cozy, quiet, introspective atmosphere.
* Slight texture, no hard edges.
* Soft interior shadows, gentle rim-lighting from the lamp and faint window moonlight.

---

## COLOR PALETTE:

* Interior wood: **#5b4736**
* Lamp glow: **#f4ce84**
* Night sky: **#1c2b3e → #0b1b2c**
* Fumes: soft greenish tint
* Star highlights / haze: **#dbe0e8**
* Optional subtle purples blending into shadows: **#7d5fff**

Palette must remain consistent with the hero scene for brand continuity.


---

## LIGHTING:

* Primary warm light source: **desk lamp** over the workbench.
* Secondary cool fill from the **night sky** through the window (very soft).
* Gentle falloff into corners of the room.
* Warm-cool contrast is essential.

---

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

* **Master aspect ratio:** 21:10
* **Recommended resolution:** 3840 × 1820 (or higher).
* Must be safe for a **center-crop 9:16** portrait without losing the workbench, lamp, or window.
* No text overlays, no UI elements, no logos.

---

## TEXT ACCURACY REQUIREMENT:

* No textual labels or readable brand names anywhere.
* All jars, tools, machines must be texture-only or unreadable scribbles.
* This scene contains **no signage**.
