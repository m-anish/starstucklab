  A wide, hand-painted digital illustration in a soft, Studio-Ghibli–inspired style. 
  The scene shows a nighttime forest clearing under a realistic summer night sky. 
  This image will be used as the master hero artwork for a website, so precise composition 
  rules must be followed.

  COMPOSITION (STRICT RULES):
  - The wooden cabin AND the wooden signboard must be placed EXACTLY at the horizontal 
    center of the image.
  - Vertically, the cabin must be positioned in the CENTER 40% of the image. 
    The cabin roof peak should be approximately at 48–52% of total image height.
    Do NOT place the cabin near the bottom edge.
  - The wooden signboard must sit just below the cabin, also centered, with its bottom edge 
    at least 10–12% ABOVE the bottom of the image. There must be a clear lower margin so
    the signboard is never clipped in wide desktop displays.
  - Maintain a clean “safe zone”: the leftmost 20% and rightmost 20% must contain only 
    trees, sky, and negative space so that a 9:16 center crop (mobile) preserves all key 
    content.
  - The entire design must remain center-weighted so the middle vertical slice forms a 
    perfect mobile composition.

  CABIN & SIGN:
  - The cabin is small and made of warm brown timber (#5b4736). 
  - One window emits a warm amber lantern glow (#f7c575), softly illuminating a dirt path.
  - In front of the cabin stands a rustic, weathered wooden signboard with hand-painted
    letters reading EXACTLY: STARSTUCKLAB (ALL CAPS). 
    Text accuracy is critical: the spelling must be STARSTUCKLAB, not Starstrucklab or any
    variation. Letters should be artisanal, slightly imperfect, integrated into the plank
    texture, but fully readable.

  SURROUNDINGS:
  - Tall, dark pine trees (#0c1c14, #11251a) form a loose circular border framing the cabin.
  - The immediate surroundings should gently fade into darkness, reinforcing the night mood.
  - Trees at the far left and right must contain no important features to preserve crop safety.

  SKY & ASTRONOMY:
  - The upper half of the image shows a deep night sky in blue-black tones (#0b1b2c → #05090f).
  - Include a faint, painterly Milky Way band running diagonally across the sky.
    Use soft haze and subtle grain (#dbe0e8).
  - Star field must feel natural, with variation in brightness and color.
  - Include the following constellations in subtle but recognizable form:
    1. Scorpius (low in the sky, slightly right of center, Antares a warm orange tone).
    2. The Summer Triangle (Vega, Deneb, Altair) higher and slightly left of center.
  - Optional: one faint, elegant shooting star in the upper-left quadrant.

  ART STYLE:
  - Painterly, soft brush strokes, slight texture.
  - No hard edges; naturalistic but whimsical.
  - Warm, magical, contemplative tone.

  COLOR PALETTE:
  - Night sky: #0b1b2c to #05090f
  - Tree shadows: #0c1c14, #11251a
  - Cabin wood: #5b4736
  - Window glow: #f7c575
  - Stars: #f8f4e8
  - Milky Way haze: #dbe0e8
  - Optional subtle purples (#7d5fff) blended lightly into upper sky

  LIGHTING:
  - The only warm light source is the cabin window.
  - Soft rim-lighting on tree silhouettes.
  - Very gentle light falloff around cabin area.

  OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
  - Master aspect ratio: 21:10.
  - Recommended resolution: 3840 × 1820 (or higher).
  - Image must be safe for center-cropping into 9:16 portrait without losing the cabin or sign.
  - No text overlays, no UI elements, no logos other than the physical signboard.

  TEXT ACCURACY REQUIREMENT:
  - The signboard MUST read: STARSTUCKLAB
  - Use all caps, no added or missing letters, no alternate spellings.
  - Letters must appear hand-painted on wood.
