# Logo Concept: The Star and the Sapling

> “From cosmic emptiness, life grows.”

## Base Concept

- **Primary symbol:** A solid black five-pointed star.
- **In the inner cleft between two lower points:** a **white sapling** with two leaves.
- **Meaning:** Hope sprouting from void.  
  Life defying entropy.  
  Engineering trying to be art.

## Variations

1. **Inverted Theme**
   - White background, black star, green sapling.
   - Feels optimistic but still minimalist.

2. **Animated SVG**
   - Star rotates slowly (like time).  
   - Sapling sways gently (like it doesn’t care).

3. **ASCII or Minimal Monochrome**
